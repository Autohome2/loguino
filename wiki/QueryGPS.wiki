#summary The GPS Poller provides access to NMEA based GPS devices.

= Overview =

The GPS Poller reads NMEA data from a serial device and logs values.  Any NMEA device is currently supported as long as it does not use a binary format.


= Wiring =

The GPS is connected to one of the serial ports, this is defined in GPS_SERIAL_DEV, the default is Serial2.  Most GPS shields require no additional wiring, simply connect the pins to the appropriate serial device on the board.

= NMEA Library =

The NMEA processing is carried out by a NMEA library which parses the string for a valid NMEA sentance.


= Available Metrics =

 * GPS.Course: The heading in degrees
 * GPS.Speed: The speed in Knots
 * GPS.Latitude: The latitude in degrees
 * GPS.Longitude: The longitude in degrees
 * GPS.Date: The date
 * GPS.Time: The time (UTC)
