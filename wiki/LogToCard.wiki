= Overview = 

Logging to SD Card allows logs to be captured on the loguino without the need for a laptop or other device to be connected. The contents of the sd card can be read by removing the sd card, or by downloading via a serial link.  

= Hardware = 

The loguino logs to an SD card connected to the board using the SPI interface, and the SD library.

= File Naming =

Each time the logger starts a new log file is created.  Log files are named sequentially, once the card is full, or there are no more unique filenames, the logger stops logging to the file.
