#summary How to test the hardware and install the correct firmware
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

Once your hardware is built, you must flash it with the latest firmware, to do so, you will need a compute with a USB port, and a USB cable to connect up your loguino board.  In this tutorial, [http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/ avrdude] is used, other options include [http://smileymicros.com/blog/2010/10/11/ardup-an-arduino-hex-file-uploader/ ardup] which may be easier for windows users.  I chose avrdude however as it is bundled with [http://www.arduino.cc Arduino] and as such should be available on all systems.

= Downloading and Building = 

Download the latest version of Loguino from the [http://code.google.com/p/loguino/downloads/list Download] section.  Unpack the archive, in the root of the loguino directory, there is a subdirectory called build, from here run ccmake. This is the menu configuration tool for cmake, run through the configuration process.  

Once cmake has been configured, run 
 make
This will build the software, once it has built, run
 make loguino-upload 

This will upload the firmware to your arduino controller.
