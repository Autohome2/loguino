#summary Describes the functionality provided by querying the megasquirt ECU.

The MegaSquirt interface captures data from the MegaSquirt engine control unit.  The contents of the registers are downloaded from the MegaSquirt controller and logged.

= Hardware Interface =

The serial interface on the Arduino mega is a TTL (link) device, this operates at or below 5v, whereas the MegaSquirt uses rs232, that uses 12volts.  In order to avoid damage to the Arduino,  voltage conversion is required, the max2323 chip accomplishes this on a single chip and is used in this instance.

= MegaSquirt Driver =

In order to communicate with the MegaSquirt, a [MegaSquirtDriver low level driver] has been created to provide an API on top of the raw serial commands.  This in itself does not provide any logging, or logging functions, but enables the logger to query the MegaSquirt without knowing anything about the underlying communication with the device.
